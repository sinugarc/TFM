\subsection{Insights and expected outcome (RQ)}

Qiskit structure in use, near QASM.

\subsection{Mutant generation}

Gate equivalence\newline

Mutation operators\newline

Randomness (for mutants and inputs?)\newline

Coverage: Study of the probability of no mutating a gate (No using code, so we are mutating over gates)
        May need to mention about the possibility of having to insert in all gaps, therefore we would need to produce more mutants and observe the minimum to ensure the right coverage with a certain significance.
