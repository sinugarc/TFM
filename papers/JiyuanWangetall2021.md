Wang, J., Zhang, Q., Xu, G. H., & Kim, M. (2021, November). Qdiff: Differential testing of quantum software stacks. In 2021 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE) (pp. 692-704).

### Bullet points:
* QDiff workflow:
  * Input program generation, preserviong semantics
  * Speed differential testing by filtering QP not worth to execute by analyzing static characteristics
  * Equivalence mechanism. KS test and cross entropy

* 3 technical challenges that make difficult to test Quantum Software Stacks (QSS)
  * Generating semantically equivalent programs to test Q compilers
  * Compilers not the only source of bugs in QSS
  * How to interpretate measurements from QP
  


### Outcome:
* QDiff evaluated in Qiskit, Corq and Pyquil


### Future work / Applications / Lacks:
* 3

### Data:

### Unknown concepts:
* 4
